# Ender Tendril

A Minecraft mod which adds growable ender pearls. Seeds can be found in some chests throughout the world. Seeds must be
planted on the bottom of a block with room to grow down. Every few blocks will produce a "flowering" tendril which will
eventually grow into a tendril pearl. Breaking the tendril will drop the pearl, but will also break every connected
block as well.
